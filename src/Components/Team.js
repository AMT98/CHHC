                    "I am a community person who has been involved with
                    community works since a young age. As a refugee immigrant
                    who moved to the US, I had the opportunity to witness and
                    experience the struggles of community members which ignited
                    my motivation and desire to help. Many community members
                    were missing hospital appointments, medicine refilling due
                    to barriers such as lack of transportation and English
                    speaking ability. As a home and day care owner for several
                    years, I have worked with numerous clients and was able to
                    maintain an outstanding relationship with the clients and
                    communities served. In 2019, I started non-emergency medical
                    transportation to provide safe and reliable transportation
                    services for Medicaid members.
                  </p>

                  <p className="mt-6">
                    My team and I wanted to ensure that Namaste became the
                    bridge between community members and health providers so
                    that members can receive health care regardless of the
                    unfortunate barriers. In 2023, I decided to establish Caring
                    Hands Home Care LLC along with my two partners Chhusang and
                    Dj to help the seniors, elderly, mentally and physically
                    challenged adults to provide home care services in the
                    comfort of their own home. Our hope is that we prioritize
                    our clientâ€™s needs and health with utmost respect, care, and
                    morale and lead our clients to living long, healthy, and
                    fulfilling lives. "

                    "I have been in the helping profession ever since I was a
                    little girl, whether by actively volunteering in non-profit
                    organizations in my home country, Nepal, or gathering
                    neighborhood kids in the evening to help them with homework
                    or school projects. The culture of care and help in me stems
                    from my upbringing in a close knit community that values
                    sharing, showing up, and becoming resilient despite the
                    difficult circumstances. These values have opened wonderful
                    opportunities for me in various places. While in school, I
                    had the opportunity to volunteer at a public library to
                    teach English language to Moroccan and Turkish refugees who
                    were working hard to build lives in Spain. English is my
                    third language so I had to put more effort and longer hours
                    to design lesson plans and curriculum. What kept me going
                    were the determined and resilient students who would show up
                    to my className everyday with a big smile and homemade meals
                    to share.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-8">
                    In the US, I have had the opportunity to work in various
                    helping industries such as mental health clinics, public
                    agencies, home care agencies, non-profit organizations, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-8">
                    In summary, all my work comes down to helping people,
                    showing up for people, and empowering people to learn from
                    each other. With the same determination and grit, I joined
                    Caring Hands Home Care to help Coloradan families become
                    healthy, happy, and empowered by providing their family
                    members with trustworthy and quality home care services at

                    "Passion... Commitment... Flexibility... David Robbinsâ€™
                    journey is a testament to selflessness and relentless
                    dedication. As one of the owners of Caring Hands Home Care,
                    my life narrative seamlessly intertwines a spirit of service
                    with a passion for care.

                  <p className="mt-8">
                    Throughout my adult years, I remained steadfast in my
                    commitment to serve and sacrifice for others. With every
                    challenge I faced, I adapted and evolved, embodying the
                    essence of resilience. As I transition into a new chapter of
                    my life, the desire to continue making a difference is
                    undiminished. The answer to my calling Caring Hands Home
                    Care is a compassionate company dedicated to the well-being
                    of its residents.The decision wasnâ€™t merely a business move;
                    it was a heartfelt one. Drawn to its Culture of Care, I
                    found that Caring Hands Home Care aligned perfectly with my
                    values and aspirations. Every service we offer, from hospice
                    care and companion care to Veterans assistance and long-term
                    adult living, is a reflection of how to care, to serve, and
                    to uplift.

                    Now, as a pivotal member of the Caring Hands Home Care
                    family, I am excited not just about the services Caring
                    Hands Home Care provides but about the impact they make.
